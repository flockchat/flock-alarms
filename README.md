# Alarms App for Flock

The Alarms app provides functionality similar to the Reminders app in Flock. It is not meant for production use -- it was expressly created to help developers get started with FlockOS. If you are new to FlockOS, we encourage you to

1. Watch the [Intro to FlockOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zQfbeh_gKk)
2. Go through the [video series](https://docs.flock.co/display/flockos/Tutorial) accompanying this app
3. Check the [API documentation](https://docs.flock.co/) for in-depth guides and reference
